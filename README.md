## Capture the Screen/Active Window in Any MS OS \(Win 95/98 or NT\)


</div>

### Description

I was having a difficult time capturing a screen or active Window from a Windows NT system. I found out that MS does some pretty quirky stuff when it comes to capturing the screen/active window and it is highly dependent upon the OS. Here is the result of a my investigations. This app will return a screen or active window capture regardless of the OS. Hope it helps anyone else in need.
